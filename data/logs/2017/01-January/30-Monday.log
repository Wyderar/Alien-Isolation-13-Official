[00:03:31] bMM-dML4 OOC: Trollarch/Trollarch : He also has a big dick
[00:03:38] bMM-dML4 OOC: Shamzie/Shamzie : Again with these claims. I admit to being a lolicon. However, I have also stated in the past that I have a burning hatred of children. Their teeth, beady eyes, straggly hair, and ear piercing voices enrage and disgust me. I am a social outcast which I have no intention to deny. Every job I have worked has been night shift, and in a job that requires little to no human interaction. Maybe the people on this discord are underestimating just how - at the cost of sounding edgy- fucked I am  when it comes to dealing with other people.
[00:03:41] bMM-dML4 OOC: Xenosandbox the Second/Xenosandbox the Second : Im friends with anyone who doesnt spout fuck and hate speech at me
